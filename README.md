# Random-particles
It is a set of particles with aleatory movement in a given space. When a particle move beyond the limits then it is re-located in the corresponding side.

The program needs two files: Main -> MC-UP-2.py where you can edit some particle properties such as size, amount, radius (markersize). Also you can change the size of the box. Secondary -> TR1.py, this file corrects the position of particles beyond the limits.
